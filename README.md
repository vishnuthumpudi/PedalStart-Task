# Project: Task Management System using PHP/MySQLi

## About The Project
The Task Management System is a simple project designed to help companies manage project task progress. The system has three types of users: Admin, Project Manager, and Regular Employee.

- **Admin**: Access to all data and manages system users.
- **Project Manager**: Manages project details and progress.
- **Regular Employee**: Submits work productivity for project tasks, including start and end times, which are calculated for project reports.

## How the System Works
- Admins create system users and new projects, listing employees who will handle project tasks.
- Regular employees update their work progress on assigned tasks and can edit their submissions.
- Project managers review employee activities, update task statuses, and generate reports.
- Only admins and project managers can access printable reports.
